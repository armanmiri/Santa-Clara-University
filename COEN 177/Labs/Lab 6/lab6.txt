// Description: Steps to setup the lab

Instructions:

1. Used the find command to search for boot - related strings such as "Copyright 2010" 

    find /usr/src -type f -exec grep -l "Copyright 2010" {} \;
    
    I found the boot message in the /usr/src/kernel/main.c file.

2. Once that boot message is found in this case in the 
    
    /usr/src/kernel/main.c inside the announce(void) function.

3. Edit the function using the vi /usr/src/kernel/main.c

    Found the section where printf prints the MINIX version and copyright information.
    
    Added a new line below the existing printf statement:

    printf("This version has been modified by [Your Name], [Year].");
    
    Saved the changes and exited using :wq.

4. Rebuilt the system using the following commands:

    cd /usr/src
    
    make world
    
    Verified that the build completed successfully.

5. Use the reboot command and check the new login message
