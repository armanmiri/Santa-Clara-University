Twitter Bot Detection Using Machine Learning

Description:
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting Twitter bots. The project delves deep into various stages of data science, from data preprocessing to model implementation.

Key Highlights:

Dataset Overview: The dataset comprises various user attributes such as screen name, followers count, friends count, and more, with a target variable indicating whether an account is a bot.

Data Processing: Comprehensive data cleaning was performed, including handling missing values and filtering out columns based on a threshold of missing data.

Visualization: Insightful visualizations were created to understand the relationship between friends and followers count, aiding in feature selection.

Feature Engineering: Introduced new binary columns based on a predefined "Bag of Words" to enhance the dataset's features. This approach helped in capturing specific patterns related to bot behavior.

Machine Learning Model: A Decision Tree Classifier was implemented to classify accounts as bots or non-bots. The model's performance was evaluated based on training and testing accuracy.

Questions Explored:
The project also delves into critical questions related to the model's performance, data splitting strategies, and the general applicability of decision trees for various classification tasks.

Includes the file for the raw data given as well for the project.
